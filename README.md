How I'm currently running the react project:

    npm run build && cp htaccess dist/.htaccess

This is a sideproject to learn some react and do some kind of blog about my projects.
I originally had a writeup.html I designed with the help of AI for the pretty CSS and was planning
on manually editing it for every project. But that sounds horrible, so I made this react project to 
split up the divs with the CSS i wanted into React Components and combine them in the different project pages.
Now the site serves what I want thanks to React Route, and its not absolutely horrible to make new blogs 
on my projects. I'm happy with this, so here it stays.
